                                <p>Being a student of Pandit Jasraj Institute is a blessed and privileged opportunity. 
                                    We strongly encourage students to pursue Music as a highly distinguished and honorable profession.  
                                </p>
                                <p>While you should be proud to introduce yourself as one, please be mindful of the responsibility and obligation that comes with it. </p>
                                <p>All students of Pandit Jasraj Institute come under the auspices and guidance of Bade Guruji, Padma Vibhushan Sangeet Martand Pandit Jasraj ji. </p>
                                <p>Due to HIS willingness, grace and generosity, HE has  provided personal guidance to some students.  </p>
                                <p>However, one does not by any means qualify to be  a ‘student of Pandit Jasrajji’. So do not introduce yourself as one.</p>
                                <p>You can most certainly introduce yourself as a ‘grand-disciple of your Bade Guruji’.</p>
                                <p>Your other options are to introduce yourself as a student under the guidance of our Guruji,‘Padma Shri’ hon’rd Pandita Tripti Mukherjee and/or a student of your respective respected Aadya Gurus, and/or the student of the Pandit Jasraj Institute. </p>
                                <p>We must always remember that Bade Guruji’s personal guidance has been attainable solely due to our dear Guruji’s dedication and tireless efforts to provide the best opportunities for the students of the Institute and the Gurukul, especially associated with this Gurukul@300128.</p>
                                <p>Being a student of Pandit Jasraj Institute makes us a Grand-Disciple of Bade-Guruji. This itself is a huge honor for all of us! </p>
                                <p>He is like a Grand-Father to us, a Grand-Father of the Guru-Shishya Parampara in Mewati Gharana and that relationship can only be established because our Guruji intended to do so. </p>
                                <p>We remain eternally bound to our dear Guruji for taking us on this journey where Bade-Guruji continues to light our path through our Guruji everyday. </p>
                                <p>None of us should ever take this destiny for granted and we will forever remain proud students of Pandit Jasraj Institute.</p>

                                <p>The name of our institution, ‘Pandit Jasraj Institute for Music Research, Artistry and Appreciation (PJIM) – the Mewati Gurukul’, describes us in a complete way. The ultimate and consummate goal of our premier Institute is to foster the preservation, growth and teaching of Indian Classical Music in the tradition of Mewati Gharana. Through this, the PJIM and its members will carry on the legacy of Mewati Gharana, along with the rich cultural traditions and values of India. Teaching music or imparting musical knowledge is only part of the vision and mission of the Institute. The members have the opportunity to set PJIM’s name on the cultural map of the United States with pride and prestige in various activities, thus becoming the true ambassadors of their own heritage.</p>
                                <p>At PJIM, students can learn music for personal as well as professional enhancement. Students can conduct research on a variety of subjects, develop their personal performance style and gain teaching experience. Students can also pursue music purely for their own knowledge, an inner satisfaction, while gaining a deeper appreciation for the tradition and shaping themselves as artists.</p>
                                <p class="mb-3">This organization is based on the traditional Guru-Shishya Parampara. PJIM is the name of a family, a tradition. This is actually the extended family of each and every proud member of PJIM. Thus, your Guru’s home is your Gurukul, the Mewati Gurukul.</p>

                                <h6 class="mt-4 mb-3 font-weight-bold">Pandit Jasraj Institute, a Guru-Shishya Tradition</h6>
                                <p>In Guru-Shishya Tradition, one aspect is to fulfill the commitment and taking care of the responsibilities for both - the Guru and the Shishya</p>
                                <p>On the Guru’s part, it is the constant commitment to enrich the Shishya with Vidya-Daan, imparting the knowledge. In a Shishya’s life, the Guru is the friend, the philosopher and the guide with a touch and the essence of the parental aspect. Thus a Guru’s responsibility and commitment to a Shishya is beyond any words and explanations.</p>
                                <p>On the disciple’s part, it is their responsibility to follow the path directed by their Guru to acquire knowledge, to be committed 100%, to participate in taking care of the system and values, making sure of their Guru’s well being , with utmost respect and true understanding.</p>
                                <p>This aspect, this world of personal touch, this eternal bonding, is the most important and integral part and the foundation of the Guru-Shishya Parampara.</p>
                                <p>And only thus, the Guru-Shishya Tradition is the<b> ‘Vidyaa-Daan’ </b>on the Guru’s behalf and paying the<b> ‘Gurudakshina’ on the Shishya’s</b> behalf  in its true real sense.</p>
                                <h6 class="mt-3 mb-3">Responsibilities and Commitments</h6>
                                <p>This music experience extends far beyond any expectations. No value can be assigned to it. The value of learning this Vidya is absolutely priceless!</p>
                                <p>All members of the Gurukul and the Institute need to detach their mind from relating the concept of ‘learning’ with  ‘monetary value’.</p>
                                <p>Imparting this Vidya by the AadyaGurus or Gurujans and getting richer and richer in terms of knowledge for  the Student, is of a value that is beyond any calculations and evaluations.</p>
                                <p>That is why we like to keep these transactional terms like ‘fees’, ‘tuition’ ‘payment’ etc detached from the lessons. Instead, we would like to view them as a monthly commitment for some practical obligations.
                                    However, for the purposes of clarity and communication, we might have to make a minimal use of these terms where needed and applicable. 
                                </p>
                                <p>There  are certain practical obligations for the Gurukul to meet. As a member of the Institute and the Gurukul, all students take a small step and contribute towards meeting those responsibilities by a nominal, regular, stable monthly commitment. This aspect of commitment and responsibility is towards meeting those practical obligations.</p>
                                <p>Please understand, as we mentioned above, that the learning is actually not tied with any monetary value and thus it is abundant and limitless….</p>

                                <p>Students are discouraged to discontinue or take a break in their learningfor any period of time, because lack of regularity hinders the continual development of their musical skills. However, if a student must discontinue for a few months, and does not wish to pay the <b>Absentee fee,</b> there will be a <b>re-joining fee</b> of one month’s monthly commitment.</p>
                                <p>A decision to re-join will not secure your place in the same group you attended prior to discontinuing.</p>
                                <p class="font-weight-bold">Special note: Please include your late, absentee or re-joining fee on your own accord.</p>
                                <h5 class="mt-4 mb-4 font-weight-bold">Make-up Classes:</h5>
                                <p>If a student misses a class, what are we trying to make up? The lesson? The time? The monetary value?</p>
                                <p>Firstly, as enumerated above, no monetary value can truly be associated with the ‘learning’ process.</p>
                                <p>Secondly, if one misses a scheduled class, it is missed forever. The time spent with Music created on that day, the discussions that take place,  the interactions between the class-mates - all these you cannot regain.</p>
                                <p>But, to be on the same page, the students should be committed to get an overview of the missed class from their Aadya-Gurus or classmates, and they should get homework assignments if any to keep themselves updated.  </p>
                                <p>This is the only way to ‘make up’ for a missed class.</p>
                                <p>Moreover, if a student is not able to actively participate in the class, he/she can still attend the class when possible, by <b>Shruti-Pathan</b> (Listen and Learn). This way, one’s learning is uninterrupted and will remain updated with the class material.</p>
                                <p>To sustain your responsibility and obligation to your Gurukul, in the event of any non-attendance over a period of time, you will still be expected to contribute a small percentage of the initial pre-determined commitment.</p>

                                <h5 class="mt-4 mb-4 font-weight-bold">Making up a missed class by the Student:</h5>
                                <p>If a student misses a scheduled class, he/she can make it up by attending any other class of the  same level with the permission of both the AadyaGurus. <b>No separate</b> individual make-up class will be scheduled.</p>
                                <p>So certainly with the extra number of classes in a few months and the longer classes we never fall behind.</p>
                                <h5 class="mt-4 mb-4 font-weight-bold">Evaluation and Examinations</h5>
                                <p>We <b>evaluate</b> students in each class and let them know their yearly progress with Award Certificates in different categories (‘<b>Mewati Deepankur’</b>, <b>‘Mewati Deepak’</b> and <b>‘Mewati Pradeept’</b> awards) at our Annual 
                                    Music Shibir - the Sur-Laya-Chhanda Mahottsav Shibir.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We also offer various <b>examinations</b> and <b>certifications</b> which are not compulsory for PJIM students, as Indian classical vocal music is one of the most difficult forms of art to master, requiring at least 25 years of learning, rigorous practice and dedication.
                                </p>
                                <p>For <b>PJIM students,</b> taking an examination is absolutely optional because we believe in the “Gurukul” system of learning. In the “Gurukul” ideology, a disciple of music continuously follows and learns from the Guru. PJIM believes that one should try to be a “disciple” of his/her Guru rather than a “student”.</p>
                                <p>Being a disciple requires a rigorous and continuous commitment to Music. In that sense, certification examinations do not matter, as the Guru and the disciple are fully aware of the disciple’s level of accomplishments and skills. We encourage our disciples to focus on learning and continuing the tradition of the Gharana, in the way it has been followed through generations. However if someone wants to take an examination as a means of quantitatively assessing his or her individual level of accomplishment, PJIM will not discourage.</p>
